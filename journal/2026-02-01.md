## Scroll Hell

### Original 🤔
Usually I frequently ask questions to AI, It responds answer but these were huge volume.  
After that I can’t hardly search what I want to know, so I did scroll down like never-ending.  
I asked AI what can I do, answer is writing suitable prompt, as follows:  
“For your aim (in my case future reference), summarize the previous questions, emphasizing the key points.”  
Definitely, I set free from “Scroll Hell.”  

### Corrected 🤖
I regularly ask AI many questions. It provides answers, but the volume is overwhelming.  
Afterward, I couldn't find what I was looking for and ended up scrolling endlessly.  
When I asked the AI for help, it instructed me to write the following prompt:  
“For the purpose (in my case, future reference), summarize my previous questions and focus on the most important points.”  
This definitely saved me from the “scroll hell.”  

### Memo (dum!)
AIが「みなおし」はやらないための人間の口実だとのたもうた  
🤖 The AI said that when humans “reference,” it's just an excuse not to do it.  

### Picked Phrase
- scrolling like never-ending. の方が断然いいでしょうに  🤖 This one is much better, isn't it?
