## Earthquake occurred

### Original
I knew that the earthquake had occurred at my hometown by the braking news apps.  
I called my younger brother at once and knew they were safe, no damage.  
I remembered the earthquake 25 years ago, my wife Y and kids stayed Matsue, I stayed Osaka.  
Till confirmed their safe, I felt hardly to breath.  

### Corrected
I learned the earthquake had struck my hometown from a news alert app.  
I immediately called my brother and confirmed they were safe and unharmed.  
It brought back memories of that earthquake 25 years ago. My wife Y and the children stayed in Matsue, while I was in Osaka.  
Until I confirmed they were safe, I felt like I couldn't breathe.  

### Memo (dum!)
速報を見て驚いて弟に電話した（本当は震度5強なら生死に関わることもあるまいと思いつつ）。  
それよりも鳥取西部地震の思い出で、家族の声を聞くまで本当に息が詰まった。  
🤖 I was shocked by the breaking news and called my brother (though I knew a magnitude 5.5 earthquake probably wouldn't be life-threatening). More than that, memories of the Tottori Western Earthquake made me feel like I couldn't breathe until I heard my family's voices.  

### Picked Phrase
- 「アプリで知った」ではなく、「学んだ」と表記するのが英語のようだ。　🤖 It seems that in English, one would say “learned” rather than “found out via an app.”  
- 主語なしでTillと書き出したら「ティルが確認するまで」だって、Untillとすべし。 🤖 If I start with “Till” without a subject, it means “until Till confirms,” so it should be “Until.”
