## Sorry Y

### Original
In the morning, I said sorry to my wife Y.  It’s been ten years since I said it.  
I got angry nonsense thing and hurtied her feelings. Usually never said sorry, it’s a bad behavior. So I regretted it every time.  
I thought should change my behavior. But it’s not effective, say sorry for her, respect Y.  

### Corrected
This morning, I apologized to my wife, Y.  
It's been ten years since I last apologized to her.  
I got angry over something trivial and hurt her feelings.  
Until now, I never apologized, and I think that's a bad habit. I regretted it every time.  
From now on, I will change my behavior. When I make Y sad, I will apologize immediately and respect her.
