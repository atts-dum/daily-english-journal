## Too much topics, Today

### Original
Today was too much topics, so I can’t be summarized a journal in 4 or 5 lines.  
I’ll write it tomorrow or later. The main topics are as follows:  
  1.  Y and I ride a train to daughter’s house, we suffered the cold.
  2.  There house was wonderful, and wallpaper simple selection was impressible.
  3.  S is blossoming into a cute girl, and I enjoyed talking with her.
  4.  I enjoyed lunch with my old friends, everyone is healthy.
  5.  A friends who teaches at a cram school told me he also encourages his students to write 3 lines English diaries.
  6.  After that I went to the Metropolitan Government Office building top, I enjoyed myself the binoculars I brought along.
  7.  I wandered around Shinjuku and Machida looking for a camera tripod.
  8.  Tonight and tomorrow, I’ll be sleeping alone in the house without Y.

### Corrected
Today's topics were a bit too many, so I can't sum up the journal in just a few lines.  
I'll get it tomorrow or the next day. Here are the main topics:  
  1.  Y and I took the train to our daughter's house, and boy, did we feel the cold!
  2.  Their house was wonderful, and the wallpaper simple selection was impressive.
  3.  S is growing into a cute girl, and I enjoyed talking with her.
  4.  I had a nice lunch with some old friends, and everyone is doing well.
  5.  A friend of mine who teaches at a cram school told me he also encourages his students to write three-line English diaries.
  6.  After that, I went to the Metropolitan Government Office building top and had a good time using the binoculars I brought.
  7.  I wandered around Shinjuku and Machida looking for a camera tripod.
  8.  Tonight and tomorrow, I'll be sleeping alone in the house without Y.
