## Climbing in the town?

### Original
I was like climbing a mountain physically, a little tired.  
One my client lives in high-rise apartment building which is one of highest in the town.  
Usually, off course I use the elevator. Unfortunately, today was inspection day.  
So I had to climb the stairs BL1 to 10th floor and delivered. Good work!!  

### Corrected
It felt like climbing a mountain, and I was a bit tired.  
One of the clients lives in one of the tallest apartment buildings in town.  
Of course, I usually take the elevator. Unfortunately, today was inspection day.  
I had to climb the stairs from the first basement level to the tenth floor to deliver the package. Good job!
