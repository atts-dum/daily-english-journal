## Thanks a lot

### Original
Y and I bought candies and chocolates to present some my clients for expressing my thanks.  
From when I started delivering service in March, I got presents from some of my clients.  
I received cookies, Ice bar and energy drinks in summer, a lot of Kaki and roast sweet potatoes in autumn from them.  
Maybe they are elder than I and feel a sense of gratitude.　Thank you for the past year!  

### Corrected
Y and I bought sweets and chocolates to express our gratitude to our clients.  
Since starting our delivery service in March, we've received several gifts from ｍy clients.  
In summer, they gave me cookies, ice cream, and energy drinks; in autumn, they presented me with many persimmons and roasted sweet potatoes.  
They're probably older than me, but everyone seems grateful. This past year, I'm the one who should be thanking them!.
