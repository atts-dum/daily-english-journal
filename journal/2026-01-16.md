## Cats fight

### Original 🤔
During the work I sometimes saw animals (include body hit by a car) from inside the car, for example tanuki, fox, squirrel.  
Cat is familiar so I saw it many times every day. But today’s cats are special. It’s looked like fight.  
Suddenly they started wrestling in front of my car. I thought now a season cat’s love affair had begun.  
They disturbed my work, so I rang the phone twice to get them away.  

### Corrected 🤖
While working, I occasionally spot animals (including roadkill) from inside my car. For example, raccoon dogs, foxes, squirrels, and such.  
Cats are a common sight, so I see them multiple times every day. But today's cats were different. They seemed to be fighting.  
Suddenly, they started wrestling right in front of my car. I suppose mating season has begun.  
Since it was interfering with my work, I honked twice to shoo them away.  

### Memo (dum!)
車から日中狸が道ばたを歩く姿を2回見た。ふつう夜中だろう。警戒心が無いのか、それとも何か問題を抱えているのか

### Picked Phrase
- cat’s love affair → matting seasonと修正、きっとドイツではこのように表現する
