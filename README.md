### A Public L2 English Learning Log from Japan (with AI Assistance)

This repository is a public learning log of my daily English journal.

I write my journal in English by myself first,  
then revise it using AI tools (mainly DeepL Translation and Write).  
Sometimes I rely on them too much. This is intentional and part of the record.

The purpose of this repository is not to show correct English,  
but to document how a Japanese English learner thinks, feels,  
and expresses daily life in English, with AI assistance.

Each entry typically includes:
- Original
- Corrected
- Memo (dum!)
- Picked Phrase (optional)

Past entries are stored in the `archive` folder.  
New entries are published daily, one file per day.

For detailed background and context,  
please see the full README_full or README_JP below.
