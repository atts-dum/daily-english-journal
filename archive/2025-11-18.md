## Is AI a friend?

### Original
I struggled to reconfiguration my oneDrive for several days.  
I used AI Google Gemini, asked how to do and got answer. My impression is positive, maybe it must be friendly. So I can do it.  
What I value most is the ability to memorize and no rejection, But I think that has a contradiction.  

### Corrected
I spent a few days trying to reconfigure OneDrive.  
I used Google Gemini AI to ask for instructions and got answers. I had a good impression and felt like I knew it well.  
What I value most is memory and the ability to not reject things, but it seemed a bit contradictory.
