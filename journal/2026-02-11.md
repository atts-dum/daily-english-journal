## Winter Sports

### Original 🤔
Now, the Winter Olympics are being held in Italy.  
Almost all games held in the very-very early morning of Japan Time.  
I don’t watch these TV programs for my health and I think live watching  is variable than video seeing.  
This is the biggest reason, but unfamiliar with winter sports.  

### Corrected 🤖
The Winter Olympics are currently being held in Italy.  
Most events take place in the very early morning hours Japan time.  
I don't watch these TV broadcasts for health reasons. I believe live broadcasts hold more value than recordings in the first place.  
That is the real reason, but honestly, I'm not very familiar with winter sports.  

### Memo (dum!)
実際は結果が気になるので、スポーツニュースはしっかりと見る　ニッポンガンバレ!!  
🤖 Actually, I'm really interested in the results, so I watch the sports news carefully. Go Japan!!  

### Picked Phrase
- I believe live broadcasts hold more value than recordings in the first place.  “in the first place”なんでこんなのが付け加えられているの？  🤖  Why is this “in the first place” thing added?
