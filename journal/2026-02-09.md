## Despite the beautiful day…

### Original 🤔
It was heavy snow(5cm deeps) for this region yesterday.  
Today It was still cold but sunny day, I could see around beautiful snow-covered landscape.  
Today’s Event；  
1．The water pipes froze, so hot water stopped  
2．Snowy roads caused traffic jams anywhere  
3．one missed delivery, so 30 minutes longer than usual  

### Corrected 🤖
Yesterday, we had an unusually heavy snowfall for this area (5 cm).  
This morning was cold, but the sun was shining, and I enjoyed the beautiful snowy scenery.  
Now, today's events:  
1．The pipes froze, so we had no hot water.  
2．Due to the snowy roads, traffic jams occurred everywhere.  
3．I forgot one delivery, so it took 30 minutes longer than usual.  

### Memo (dum!)
2014年の昨日は10cm積もった　ボクだけではなく、社会全体が雪に弱くなっている気がする  
🤖 Yesterday in 2014, 10 cm of snow fell. It's not just me—it feels like society as a whole has become more vulnerable to snow.  

### Picked Phrase
- I forgot one delivery, so it took 30 minutes longer than usual.　正しくはこうなるだろうけど、因果をスマートに表現したかった　🤖 This is probably the correct way to put it, but I wanted to express the cause-and-effect relationship more elegantly.
