## Weekend

### Original
I like always Friday.  
So next day is holiday, I forgot fatigue and worked hard to hurry home. I enjoyed much meals and drinks.  
But now, too much alcoholic are bad for health. Indeed I sometimes felt stomachache.  
Anyway, l keep health and enjoy weekends with my fife.  

### Corrected
I always liked Fridays.  
Since the next day was a holiday, I forgot about my fatigue and worked hard to hurry home. I enjoyed meals and drinks.  
But now, drinking too much alcohol is bad for my health. In fact, I sometimes get a stomachache.  
In any case, I want to stay healthy and enjoy weekends with my wife.
