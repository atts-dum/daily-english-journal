## BBC Proms

### Original
I didn’t watch BBC program Proms this year. Because BBC app is to be difficult to use, especially outside Uk users.  
I just happened to feel like watching it, so searching YouTube and fond programs.  
Full orchestra played gorgeous music and I find a musician St.Vincent. She is a sing a song writer, talented, but singing voice isn’t very good.  

### Corrected

I just happened to feel like watching it, so I searched YouTube and found the program.  
A full orchestra played gorgeous music, and I found a musician named St. Vincent. She is a singer-songwriter and talented, but her singing voice isn’t very good.
