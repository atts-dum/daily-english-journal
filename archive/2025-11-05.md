## Don’t keep the horn

### Original
Car horns are very important which let pedestrians know car approaching. But someone keep the  horn to prompt moving away and threat.  
I think it is clear signs of impatience, it use when it need.  
Honestly I said, I did three times yesterday in upset motion.  
Safe driving need less horns.  

### Corrected
Car horns are super important because they let people know when a car is coming.  
But someone kept the horn, signaling to move away and show some strength.  
I think it's pretty obvious. It's a sign of impatience. It's used when it's needed.  
Honestly, I said I did three times yesterday in upset motion.  
Safe driving means fewer horns.
