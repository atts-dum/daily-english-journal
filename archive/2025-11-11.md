## Reduce Weight

### Original
I made decision at beginning of this year, reducing my weight.  
At that time, that was 85kg, by the end of the year, aim for under 80kg.  
Minimum was 80.1kg at May 16th, but now 83kg. So called ”rebound”.  
It seems impossible achieving my goal.  
 
### Corrected
I decided to lose weight at the start of this year.  
At that time, I was 85 kg. I'm aiming to be under 80 kg by the end of the year.  
The minimum was 80.1 kg on May 16, but it's now 83 kg. It's what they call a "rebound."  
It seems impossible to achieve my goal.
