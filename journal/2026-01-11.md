## Shopping with Y again!

### Original
We go shopping again, Y fond the disaster preparedness leaflet so she wanted to get it.  
It’s supplies famous on TV commercial, but Net-world said it dealing junk items.  
I felt a little uneasy but we bought the “Emergency Toilet with Tent”!!  

### Corrected
My wife wanted the disaster supplies she saw advertised, so we went shopping again.  
It's a product from a company that's well-known for its TV commercials, but online, it's considered a company that makes poor-quality products.  
I was a little worried, but I decided to buy the "Emergency Toilet with Tent" anyway!  

### Memo (dum!)
便座がひどい。荷重体重200kgとあってお相撲さんでも大丈夫なことになるけれど、絶対ウソだ。凝固剤だけは使えそう。

### Picked Phrase
- famous on TV commercialなんて当てずっぽうな表現を使わず、素直な表現があるんだな。
