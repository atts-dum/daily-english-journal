## Christmas Present

### Original
Today I got the Christmas present for my granddaughter, R by home delivery.  
That requested her dad before, I’ve notified him of the arrival, so he’ll come pick it up right away.  
By the way, I don’t know how to use the toy I present as a gift. Y and me want R to be happy.  

### Corrected
Today, the Christmas present for our granddaughter R arrived at our house.  
It was what her dad had requested from us, so we told him it had arrived. He said he'd come pick it up right away.  
By the way, I'm not quite sure how to use the toy we're giving her. Y and I really want R to be happy with it.
