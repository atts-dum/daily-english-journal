## Pillow replacement

### Original 🤔
I fell dull ache when I wake up, that is a dull, pulling pain extending from the back of the neck to the temples and across the forehead.  
It’s time to replace my pillow! This one is half the height when I bought it.  
I have to order on the IKEA website.  

### Corrected 🤖
When I wake up, I feel a dull ache. It starts at the back of my neck and spreads upward, pulling all the way to my forehead.  
It's time to replace my pillow. It's lost about half its height since I bought it.  
I need to order one from the IKEA website.  

### Memo (dum!)
「首の後ろからこめかみ、そして額にかけて広がる引っ張られるような鈍い痛み」なんて表現、DeepLの助けがないと書けない　もっともこの先使いそうもない表現ではあるけれど  
🤖 “A dull, pulling pain extending from the back of the neck to the temples and across the forehead”—I couldn't have written that without DeepL's help. Though I doubt I'll ever need to use that phrase again.  

### Picked Phrase
- ache or pain 　　acheはズキズキする鈍く持続的な痛み、painは鋭く一時的な強い痛み　今回は前者　🤖 ache is a dull, persistent throbbing pain; pain is a sharp, temporary, intense pain. This time it's the former.
