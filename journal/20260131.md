## A half portion?

### Original 🤔
I had the bento that my wife bought at our usual bento shop for lunch.  
I was surprised about  my favorite bento, so the price was same, but the portion was half size!  
What’s the matter?  
Does it change the management policy, or the impact of rising prices?

### Memo (dum!)
30年以上続く弁当屋さんだけど、量を半分にして商売が続くかな　心配　ボクは支えるけど
🤖 It's a bento shop that's been around for over 30 years, but I'm worried if halving the portions will keep the business going. I'll support it though.
