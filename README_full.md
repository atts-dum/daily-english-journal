## A Longitudinal Case Study of AI-Mediated English Learning by a Soon-to-be 70-Year-Old Japanese Learner

This is a daily English diary written by a Japanese learner and corrected with AI tools.

This repository is a Public L2 English Learning Log and serves as a unique dataset for researchers in Digital Anthropology, Sociolinguistics, and AI-Mediated Communication (AIC).

It documents the autoethnographic journey of a Japanese learner navigating the intersection of aging, digital legacy, and human–AI symbiosis, as I approach the milestone of my 70th birthday.

## Background: Digital Aging and Legacy

I believe I may have about ten healthy years left. With that in mind, I decided to abandon the lofty ambitions I once held about “mastering English,” along with many inefficient and often wasteful efforts I made over the years.

At this point, I chose to give up trying to look competent. Instead, I decided to openly expose my actual state as an English learner—to rely heavily on AI tools and to record what I might have been able to write if I had worked harder or smarter. This project is a form of “Digital Aging” and a record of my “Digital Estate Planning” (デジタル終活).

On October 14, 2025, I began writing a diary in Apple Journal. This repository is a public release of that content, serving as a live archive of my thoughts and linguistic struggles.

> **Archive note:** Earlier entries (from **October 14, 2025** to **January 15, 2026**) are stored in the `archive/` folder and contain **only** *Original* and *Corrected* texts.

## For Researchers: An Open Learner Corpus

I specifically invite English teachers (ALTs, JTEs, and instructors) working in Japanese schools to refer to this log.

Standard textbooks often fail to capture the “real face” of a Japanese learner—the hesitation, the specific psychological barriers, and the over-reliance on translation. This log provides insights into the gap between a learner's true intent and their actual output, and how AI can serve as a “wall-bouncing partner” (壁打ち相手) for long-term self-study.

I also hope this log may be of interest to developers and designers of AI language tools.  
The contrast between the Original and AI-corrected texts may offer practical insights into how learners actually use AI, where they depend on it, and how AI-mediated feedback shapes their expression over time.

## Structure of the Diary

Each daily entry typically consists of:

- **Original:** The raw text I wrote by myself (revealing raw ability).
- **Corrected:** A revised version generated using AI tools (mainly DeepL Translation/Write).
- **Memo (dum!):** Rough, casual, and half-silly personal notes to capture my state of mind, written in Japanese.
- **Picked Phrase:** Specific expressions I found useful during the process.

## A Note on Authenticity and “Cheating”

Please do not assume my English is at a certain level based on the polished parts.

Even when writing the Original entries, I often rely on dictionary apps or AI for spelling and expressions I could not produce on my own. Therefore, these texts do not accurately reflect my pure language ability; the reality is much lower. However, documenting this AI-mediated process is the core intent of this project.

## Closing Note

This is a personal L2 English learning log from Japan. Nothing more, and nothing less.

If you find this README well-written, it is only because of the assistance of my AI partner, helping me reach the world from my corner of Japan.
