## Am I allright?

### Original
I felt a little tired this morning and had yawing. It’s unusual before heading out to work.  
I had good sleep for 8 hours and not caught a cold either.  
Mental issues? Didn't I want to go to work? No, Anyway I must do my job properly.  

### Corrected
I felt tired and yawned a lot this morning. That's unusual before heading out to work.  
I slept well for eight hours, and I haven't caught a cold either.  
Mental issues? Did I not want to go to work? No, but I must do my job properly anyway.
