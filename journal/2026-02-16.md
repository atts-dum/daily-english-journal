## My weaknesses in English

### Original 🤔
I ordered Gemini to analyze my journal ( Original 🤔 ) to identify my weaknesses in English.
The  following 5 points:
		1．Omission of Articles (a, an, the)
		2．Part-of-speech confusion (adjectives, nouns, verbs)
		3．Verb Form and Tense/Agreement
		4．Word Choice (Vocabulary/Spelling)
		5．Incomplete Syntax (Conjunctions/Prepositions)
So what?　I have DeepL as a powerful tool!
