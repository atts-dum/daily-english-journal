## Might be panic?

### Original 🤔
Today I honked my horn three times for no reason, showed no improvement.  
I thought my short temper was the cause, but now it’s a sort of panic.  
When I saw the unusual thing, my body(in this case, right arm) respond and honk the horn quickly.  
I say it’s a panic.  

### Corrected 🤖
Today I honked the horn three times for no particular reason, but I see absolutely no improvement.  
I used to think it was due to my short temper, but now I suspect it might be a kind of panic reaction.  
The moment I saw something unusual, my body (in this case, my right arm) reflexively honked the horn.  
This can certainly be called a panic reaction.
