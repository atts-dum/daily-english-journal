## My Cars

### Original 🤔
Today, It’s been two years since my Suzuki Jimny delivered.  
I think it’s a small car, but useful for my work, so it’s too valuable for me.  
I had owned nine cars: three Mazda, three Volvo, two Suzuki, and one Volkswagen.  
Jimny is the best! But I’m worried about the cost of next year’s vehicle inspection…. 

### Corrected 🤖
Today marks two years since I purchased my Suzuki Jimny.  
Though it's a kei car, it's been very useful for work. It's extremely valuable to me.  
I've owned nine cars so far: three Mazdas, three Volvos, two Suzukis, and one Volkswagen.  
The Jimny is the best! However, I'm concerned about next year's vehicle inspection costs.  

### Memo (dum!)
「車検費用が心配なんだけどー」と心の機微を表そうと思ったが、何だか事務的な修正になったな  
🤖  I meant to express my inner feelings—like, “I’m worried about the cost of next year’s vehicle inspection….”—but somehow it corrected into a rather businesslike revision.  

### Picked Phrase
- three Mazdasとしっかりと複数形にする　🤖 Make it plural.
