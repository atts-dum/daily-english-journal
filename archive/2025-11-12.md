## Short tempered

### Original
I must admit I’m short tempered. Why I can’t control the anger?  
I get angry at home, on work, anywhere, anytime.  
I suppose if I were to die, it would be in anger, it is ridiculous and unhappy.  

### Corrected
I'll admit that I have a short temper. Why can't I control my anger?  
I get angry at home, at work, anywhere, anytime.  
If I were to die, it would be from anger. It's ridiculous and unhappy.
