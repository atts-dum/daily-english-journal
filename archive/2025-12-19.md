## Broken Senbei

### Original
I bought Nambu Senbei, my favorite cracker, at neighbor drugstore last Friday.  
At that time there were all broken, so I send a email to customer center which write what happed, requested for identifying the cause and countermeasures.  
A few days later I got reply which said we’ll do quickly and please wait our report for one week.  
I didn’t got the report, but I want to the senbei, so visited again.  
Broken senbei were still sitting on the sore shelf, so I complained to the manager.  
Is he even motivated?  

### Corrected
Last Friday, I bought my favorite crackers, Nanbu Senbei, at a nearby drugstore.  
They were all broken, so I emailed the customer service center. I described what happened and asked them to identify the cause and solution.  
A few days later, I received a reply stating they would “handle it urgently,” and was told to wait a week for the report.  
The report never arrived, but I wanted to crave the senbei and went back to the store.  
The broken senbei were still on the shelf, so I complained to the store manager.  
Is he really motivated?
