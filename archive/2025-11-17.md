## Short-tempered once again

### Original
I shame my short-tempered, so I don’t want to write about it.  
regreting every time. But I did once again.  
I need study the anger-control theory. How embarrassing.  

### Corrected
I'm embarrassed by my short temper, so I don't want to talk about it.  
I always end up regretting it, but I've done it again.  
I really need to learn anger management theory. I'm really embarrassed.
