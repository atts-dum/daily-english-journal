## Brain Flexibility

### Original
They say human brain is like a sponge. But absorbing ability is limited, I think deteriorating with age. Perhaps to be stone.  
There is a reason I wish for flexibility in the brain. During the work, I always listen to English audio materials.  
I can’t pay much attention to it, actuary no memory.  
But human brain memorize it without awareness. I wish so.   

### Corrected
People often say the human brain is like a sponge. But I think the body's absorption capacity has limits, and it declines with age. It might even turn to stone.  
There's a reason I'm so particular about keeping my brain flexible. At work, I always listen to English audio materials.  
I can't concentrate, and the information doesn't stick.  
But the human brain remembers things without the person even realizing it. I wish that were true.
