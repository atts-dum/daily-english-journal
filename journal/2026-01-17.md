### Corrected 🤖
The weather today is sunny. But the sky turned yellow this afternoon.  
The yellow sand came from the desert in Asia.  
I lived in Japan when I was a child, so I am familiar with that town. But they are rare in the Kanto region.  
People put on their masks and bring the laundry inside. I don't care.  

### Memo (dum!)
DeepL Writeは文才がありすぎて原文を著者の意図以上に飾ってくれる。それにしても日本には子どもの時からずっと住んでるY

### Picked Phrase
- I lived in Japan when I was a child, so I am familiar with that town.勝手に変質させるな！！ボクは日本海側に住んでいて黄砂にはなれていると書いたつもり
- 後から気づいたけどJapan-seeはないわナ　気を遣ってくれたみたい
