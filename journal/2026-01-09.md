## Suppress appetite

### Original 🤔
Long hours?(Well, it was only 6 hours) but I feel tired today. And late lunch, I had too much food.  
I’ wonder if getting fat again, feeling down now.  
Holidays are dangerous I can easily have snacks and drinks. I have to suppress appetite.  

### Corrected 🤖
Long hours?(Well, it was only six hours) but I feel tired today. I had a late lunch and ate too much.  
I wonder if I'm gaining weight again and feeling depressed.  
It's dangerous to have snacks and drinks during the holidays. I have to stop myself from eating too much.  

### Memo (dum!)
食欲を抑えなければ　ボクにとっては6時間は長時間労働、遅い昼飯で過食また太りそうだ。明日は間食を控えなければ  
🤖 If I don't curb my appetite, six hours feels like a long shift to me. A late lunch means overeating and gaining weight again. Tomorrow, I must cut back on snacks.  

### Picked Phrase
- 「Holidays are dangerous」はさすがにダサっ  🤖 That's really lame.
