Of course I noticed and corrected immediately, I must reduct errors.  

### Corrected
This morning, my client held a safe driving seminar before work began.  
It was extremely beneficial and made me reconsider the importance of safe driving.  
I was a bit nervous while driving and mistakenly delivered to another user.  
I noticed the error immediately and corrected it. I will strive to reduce mistakes going forward.
