## Go to the Dentist

### Original
When I was a kid, summer vacations were beginning of terrible days.  
My mother said you must go to the dentist, it was terrifying to me even with toothache.  
In the TV program, a dentist said once upon a time, people went when felt pain, but now go to prevent cavities.  
I went to the dentist for my routine care every three months.  

### Corrected
When I was a kid, summer vacations were the start of some pretty rough days.  
My mom always told me to go to the dentist, but even when I was in pain, it was still pretty scary.  
A dentist on the TV show said that people used to go to the dentist when they felt pain, but now they go to prevent cavities.  
I went to the dentist today for my regular check-ups every three months.
