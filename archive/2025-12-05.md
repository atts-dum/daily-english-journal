## Full monon

### Original
I saw the full moon three times in a day, today.  
First, When I awake early at 5 o’clock, I noticed slight moon light through the window.  
Second, When I got up and open the window, I saw the moon sinking over the Koubou-yama.  
And then Y and me saw the rising moon on the way to shopping.   

### Corrected
I saw the full moon three times today.  
First, when I woke up early at 5 a.m., I noticed the moonlight coming through the window.  
Second, when I got up and opened the window, I saw the moon setting over Koubou-yama.  
Y and I saw the moon coming up on our way to the store.
