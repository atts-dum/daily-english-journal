## Wild threats?
### Original
I saw a police car during the job that delivered supper’s box in mountainsides living customers.  
Police said by mic “Monkeys appeared, be careful, lock your doors and windows”.  
I remembered I saw monkeys near my house abut 30 years ago. But until now, I hadn’t.
I think climate changes occurred a luck of foods for  animals in wild life.  
They wander searching foods to human’s sites.  
 In North Japan bears appear and hurt people,someone killed, We fear now.  
Bearers and monkeys are in same situation.  
Are they Wild threats?  

### Corrected
While delivering supper boxes to customers in the mountains, I saw a police car.  
The police officer said over the mic, "Monkeys have appeared. Be careful. Lock your doors and windows."  
I remembered seeing monkeys near my house about 30 years ago. But I hadn't seen any since then.  
I think climate change has caused a shortage of food for wild animals.  
They wander around looking for food in human areas.  
 In northern Japan, bears appear and hurt people. Someone was killed. Now, we are afraid.  
Bears and monkeys are in the same situation.  
Are they a wild threat?
