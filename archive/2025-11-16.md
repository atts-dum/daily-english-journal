## Watching a movie

### Original
I watched Netflix, A House of Dynamite, that’s about 120 minutes.  
Suddenly invisible enemy launched ICBM to USA, The movie express three scenes among 18 minutes till explosion.  
1st scene is about on-site personnels, 2nd is about high-ranking officials, and 3rd, appear the President.  
These were fascinating to see each person’s fears and struggles described.  
The ending was unclear was unsettling.  

### Corrected
I watched Netflix's A House of Dynamite. It's about 120 minutes long.  
An enemy that had never shown itself before suddenly launched an ICBM missile toward the United States. The film depicts the 18 minutes until detonation across three distinct scenes.  
The first scene focuses on the personnel on the ground, the second on the higher-ups, and the third introduces the President.  
The portrayal of each character's fear and inner conflict was truly fascinating.  
The ending was ambiguous and unsettling, leaving a lingering sense of unease.
