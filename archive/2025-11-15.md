## Planting and Harvesting

### Original
Y and I went to the Waku-Waku Farm which is community garden hosted by the Wada family. We are member since 2019.  
Today we planted onions that will harvest  next spring. Last year’s was the best, so I’am looking forward to it.  
And we harvested Japanese yams, Satoimo, these were not too bad.  
We’ll sent them to our daughter N on Monday.
