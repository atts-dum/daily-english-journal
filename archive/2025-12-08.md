## Improve English

### Original
I’ve been writing the journal for over 55 days, moreover, without fail.  
I must say, it’s quite achievement, isn’t it?  
But I have no confidence that my English will improve.  
So think I’d put my journal to good use. I’ll talk more about the specifics later.  

### Corrected
I've been keeping the journal for over 55 days, and I've done it every day.  
I have to say, that's quite an achievement, isn't it?  
I'm not sure if my English will improve, though.  
I think I'd be able to put my journal to good use. I'll fill you in on the nitty-gritty later.
