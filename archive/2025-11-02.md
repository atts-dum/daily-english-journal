## Watching the whole game

### Original
I watched last mach Dodgers vs Blue Jays, almost four hours.  
Both players were nervous, porker face were mean-less, they did best.  
I was deeply moved. Sports is Wonderfull!  

### Corrected
I watched the Dodgers vs. Blue Jays World Series game. It lasted nearly four hours.  
The players on both teams were tense. Poker faces were meaningless. They gave it their all.  
I was deeply moved. Sports are amazing!
