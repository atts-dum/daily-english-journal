## System literacy
### Original
Recently I feel a lack of capability to use computer applications. There’re problems knowledge about system, I can’t catch up them.  
Because  Nobody use PC around me, there no inspiration. YouTube is effective but I lose patience. So my understandings are low level.  
So called System literacy, my big problem.  

### Corrected
Lately, when using computer applications, I've been feeling inadequate. I often don't fully understand how to operate them.  
There's no one around me who uses a PC, so I have no one to turn to for help. YouTube is useful, but my patience wears out quickly. As a result, my level of understanding remains low.  
System literacy seems to be a major challenge for me.
