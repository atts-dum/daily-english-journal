## Using the calendar as a diary

### Original
I digitize my past events. Specifically, I scan past diaries.  
My diaries were described only events; no impressions, so I can write in the Google Calendar.  
I’ve been carrying out for end-of-life planning. Digitizing are important.  

### Corrected
I digitize my past events. I'm especially into scanning past diaries.  
My diaries were just events, no impressions, so I can write in the Google Calendar.  
It’s  part of end-of-life planning. Digitizing is important.
