## Campaign car

### Original 🤔

No campaign car, No candidates and supporter I can see, even though I delivery every day.  
I can’t believe that’s being excited on TV, newspapers, online. I feel like an another world.  
I don’t want to vote for invisible person.  

### Corrected 🤖
There are only three days left before the House of Representatives election, and the atmosphere around me is completely quiet.    
There is no campaign car or candidates and supporters to be seen, even though I deliver every day.  
I can't believe that people are showing so much excitement about it on TV, in newspapers, and online. I feel like I'm in another world.  
I don't want to vote for an invisible person.  

### Memo (dum!)
小田原から遠いからといって、一度も姿をみせないというのはこちらの有権者を馬鹿にしてる  
🤖 Just because it's far from Odawara doesn't mean they can never show their face—that's treating us voters like fools.  

### Picked Phrase
- an another world → another world  なんでこうなる？  🤖 Why does this happen?
