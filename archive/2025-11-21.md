## Between Seasons

### Original
In between the seasons, now Autumn has switched winter.  
My mentality is change in emotion. I can’t believe myself.  
I feel a little bit tired, get a good night’s sleep.  

### Corrected
As the seasons change, fall is now giving way to winter.  
It's hard to believe, but my emotions change so easily this time of year.  
I'm a bit tired, so I'll probably sleep well.
