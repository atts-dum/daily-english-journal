## Sports

### Original
I watched the TV two sports games, baseball and rugby.  
Baseball was Dodgers vs Blue Jays and rugby was Japan vs Australia.These result were 11 to 4 and 15 to 19.  
Both matches were exciting, but rugby was particularly interesting. So Japan didn’t win Australia past 50 years, but they did a good fight. They’ll likely win soon.  
Shohei Ohtani’s success has made MLB popular in Japan, so I watched, but I felt little boring.  
Generally I’ve never watch a baseball game until the end, very special today.  

### Corrected
 I watched two sports games on TV: baseball and rugby.  
The baseball game was the Dodgers vs. the Blue Jays, and the rugby game was Japan vs. Australia. The scores were 11-4 and 15-19, respectively.  
Both matches were exciting, but the rugby match was particularly interesting. Japan hasn’t beaten Australia in over 50 years, but they put up a good fight. They'll likely win soon.  
Shohei Ohtani’s success has made the MLB popular in Japan, which is why I watched. However, I found it a bit boring.  
I've never watched a baseball game until the end before, but today was different.
