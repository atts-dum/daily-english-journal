Actually, I was invited, but I asked her to go instead me.

She thought too be late!!  

### Corrected
Y attended a lifestyle disease prevention cooking class held by the city hall.  
I was invited too, but I asked her to go in my place.  
“There were all sorts of people there,” she said. “One person who was a bit overweight said, ‘I don't know how to stop eating snacks.’”  
And she thought, “It's already too late!”
