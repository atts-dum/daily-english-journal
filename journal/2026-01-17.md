## Sunny, but Yellowing

### Original 🤔
Today’s weather is sunny. But the sky turned yellow this afternoon.  
Yellow sand arrived from the Asia continental desert.  
When I kids I lived in Japan-see said town, so it’s familia. But rare in Kanto region.  
People put mask and bring the laundry inside. I don’t care about it.  

### Corrected 🤖
The weather today is sunny. But the sky turned yellow this afternoon.  
The yellow sand came from the desert in Asia.  
I lived in Japan when I was a child, so I am familiar with that town. But they are rare in the Kanto region.  
People put on their masks and bring the laundry inside. I don't care.  

### Memo (dum!)
DeepL Writeは文才がありすぎて原文を著者の意図以上に飾ってくれる。それにしても日本には子どもの時からずっと住んでるY　　
🤖 DeepL Write is so eloquent it embellishes the original text beyond the author's intent. Even so, I've lived in Japan since childhood.


### Picked Phrase
- I lived in Japan when I was a child, so I am familiar with that town.勝手に変質させるな！！ボクは日本海側に住んでいて黄砂にはなれていると書いたつもり  🤖 Don't twist my words!! I wrote that I live on the Sea of Japan side and am used to yellow sand.  
- 後から気づいたけどJapan-seeはないわナ　気を遣ってくれたみたい  🤖 I realized later that Japan-see isn't available. Seems like they were being considerate.
