### Corrected
The weather today is sunny. But the sky turned yellow this afternoon.  
The yellow sand came from the desert in Asia.  
I lived in Japan when I was a child, so I am familiar with that town. But they are rare in the Kanto region.  
People put on their masks and bring the laundry inside. I don't care.
