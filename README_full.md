### A Public L2 English Learning Log from Japan (with AI Assistance)

This repository is a public learning log of my daily English diary.

I write my Journal in English by myself first.  
Then I revise it using AI tools (mainly DeepL Translation and Write).  
Sometimes I rely on them more than I probably should.  
This is intentional—and part of the record.

The purpose of this repository is not to demonstrate correct or polished English,  
but to document how a Japanese English learner thinks, feels, hesitates,  
and expresses daily life in English, with the help of AI.

## Background

I believe I may have about ten healthy years left.

With that in mind, I decided to abandon the lofty ambitions I once held about “mastering English,”  
along with many inefficient and often wasteful efforts I made over the years.

At this point, I chose to give up trying to look competent.

Instead, I decided to openly expose my actual state as an English learner,  
to rely heavily on AI tools, and to record what I *might* have been able to write  
if I had worked harder or smarter—while half-indulging in a sense of self-pity.

On October 14, 2025, almost on a whim, I began writing a diary in Apple Journal.  
This repository is a public release of that content.

## What This Repository Is (and Is Not)

The diaries published here are, in principle, unprocessed.  
Except for anonymizing personal names, the text is presented as it was written.

This is a collection of reflections from someone in their late 60s—  
someone who has spent nearly fifty years struggling, often clumsily, with English.

As L2 English data, the original texts reveal:
- Japanese-influenced thinking and word order
- Repeated grammatical and lexical mistakes
- Persistent patterns that do not easily disappear

In that sense, this repository may also illustrate the effects of growing up in Japan,  
a society where foreign languages are rarely required in daily life.

## A Note on “Cheating”

Please don’t say, “You’re actually pretty good at English.”

I am not.

Even when writing the original entries, I often relied on dictionary apps or AI  
for spelling and expressions that I could never produce on my own.  
Therefore, these texts do not accurately reflect my pure language ability.  
The reality is much lower.

## Structure of the Diary

Each daily entry typically consists of:

- **Original** – the text I wrote by myself  
- **Corrected** – a revised version generated using DeepL Write  
- **Memo (dum!)** – rough, slightly foolish personal notes  
- **Picked Phrase** (optional)

“Memo (dum!)” means casual and half-silly notes.  
I don’t think deeply there. I just write what comes to mind.

Sometimes I write reflections separately.  
This is a public learning log, not a finished product.

## Archive and Current Entries

At the time of publication, I had accumulated nearly 90 days of entries.

Past entries are stored in the `archive` folder.  
Their formats may vary and are preserved mostly as they were.

From today onward, new entries are published as one file per day.

## On AI Correction Style

For the corrected sections, I previously used a more casual style in DeepL Translation and Write.  
I now use the “general” style, which I feel better aligns with the intent of this project.

## Closing Note

This is a personal L2 English learning log from Japan.  
Nothing more, and nothing less.

If you are thinking, “This README is better written than expected,”  
you are right—and it is only because of AI assistance.
