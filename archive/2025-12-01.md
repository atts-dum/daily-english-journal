### Original
The twelfth month has begun. We feel rushed so finish own work till year end.  
I write three tings that I have to do it.  
  1.  Start data entering for tax filing

  3.  Resumption data entering for End-of-life planning  

Let’s get started!  



### Corrected
The twelfth month is here. We're feeling a bit rushed, so we're going to try to wrap up our work by the end of the year.  
I jot down three things that I've got to get done.  
  1.  Let's start entering data for the tax filing.
  2.  Let's start publishing the project and writing the text.
  3.  Let's resume entering data for the end-of-life planning.  

Let's get started!
