## 📝 Project Overview
This repository documents a daily English diary process:  
**Self-Written Draft → AI Correction (DeepL) → Reflection.**  

It is not a display of "perfect English," but a raw, longitudinal record of a Japanese learner's psychological and linguistic struggles as I approach my 70s.

## 🎓 Value for Researchers & Educators
* **For Linguists:** An open learner corpus showcasing persistent errors ("Fossilization") and Japanese-influenced syntax.
* **For Anthropologists:** A record of "Digital Aging" and legacy-building through technology.
* **For Teachers (ALT/JTE):** A rare window into the "real face" and internal barriers of adult Japanese learners.
* **For AI Scholars:** Data on the "delta" (gap) between human output and AI-mediated communication (AIC).

## 📂 Entry Structure
1. **Original:** Raw, unpolished English output.
2. **Corrected:** Revised version by AI tools.
3. **Memo (dum!):** Casual reflections on daily life and the learning process, written in Japanese.
4. **Picked Phrase:** Useful expressions acquired.
