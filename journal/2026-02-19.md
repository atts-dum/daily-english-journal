## User hospitalization

### Original 🤔
When I went to deliver to my regular user, a 97 years old women, she was on her way to a hospital with her family.  
I heard she has dementia, she can’t live alone, so hospitalization has been decided.  
She is very charming, say always my mother lived till 102 years old.  
I’ll wait her coming home.  

### Corrected 🤖
When I went to deliver to the home of a 97-year-old woman, she was on her way to the hospital with her family.  
Because of her dementia, she could no longer live on her own and was going to be admitted to a nursing home.  
She is a very charming person. She always said her mother lived to be 102.  
I'm waiting for her to return home.  

### Memo (dum!)
高齢であっても、近くに住む家族に面倒をかけず元気に暮らしていたおばあさんです  
🤖 She was an elderly woman who lived energetically without burdening her family living nearby, even in her advanced age.  

### Picked Phrase
- I'm waiting for her to return home.  これは未来形ではなく現在進行形にしなければ　🤖  This should be in the present progressive tense, not the future tense.
