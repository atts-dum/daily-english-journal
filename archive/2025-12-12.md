## Year-End Party 0rganizer

### Original
I do the organizer at this time of year.  
It’s been years since I stoped commuting to Tokyo, my friends seem to think I know geography about entertainment district.  
Actually I’m not familiar with it, so I used the AI to search for good restaurants.  
Anyway I’ll looking forward to the Year-End Party on 28th December.  

### Corrected
I'm the one who handles the organization during this time of year.  
It's been ages since I stopped commuting to Tokyo, and my friends seem to think I know my way around the entertainment district.  
To be honest, I don't really know what it is, so I used the AI to find some good restaurants.  
Anyway, I'm looking forward to the year-end party on December 28.
