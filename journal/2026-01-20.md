## Snowfall?

### Original 🤔
It looks like snow is going to fall.  
Mt. Ooyama seen from the window is completely hidden the cloud and dropped down the temperatures in the afternoon.  
I’m lucky to prepare studless tires early.  

### Corrected 🤖
Snow looks like it might fall.  
From the window, Mount Ooyama is hidden by clouds. The temperature dropped in the afternoon.  
I'm glad I got my studless tires ready early.  

### Memo (dum!)
雪が降って明日の配達に支障がでると困るけど、愛車ジムニーは心強い

### Picked Phrase
- in the afternoon 「午後から」気温が下がってきたと表そうとするとこうなる。fromは使わない
