## Diet

### Original
I feel a little hungry while working because I work during lunchtime and usually having lunch at past 2.Lunchtime isn’t problem, the volume is serious issue, especially having much snack after lunch immediately.  
The doctor warned you should lose weight, so I did that got four Kg down since beginning of the year.  
But I can’t loose weight more.  
I have to diet.
