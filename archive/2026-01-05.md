## First day of work

### Original
Vacations passed first. Today was first day of work.  
When I was salaryman I used to felt tired of going to work.  
But now I have almost no responsibility for the work, so easy going.  
Rather, I feel refreshed to start the work.  

### Corrected
My vacation is over. Today is my first day back at work.  
When I was a company employee, going to work was a drag.  
But now that I have almost no responsibility at work, I can take it easy.  
In fact, I can start work feeling refreshed.
