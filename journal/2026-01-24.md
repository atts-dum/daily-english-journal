## Forgotten Subscription

### Original 🤔
I fond a subscription that I forgot it for a while, and payed fee without using for two years.  
That is, Notion apps, AI recommended to use what it was useful to organize information.  
So I’ll continue the subscription, I’ll never waste money.  

### Corrected 🤖
I found a subscription I had forgotten about. I had been paying for it for two years, but I didn't use it.  
It was the Notion app, which AI recommended as helpful for organizing information.  
I'll continue the subscription to avoid wasting money.

### Memo (dum!)
本来無料版でも十分だというのに…　さらに今より高いアップグレードまでしてしまった  

### Picked Phrase
- I'll continue the subscription to avoid wasting money.はお金を無駄にしないぞという決意と、違う訂正になったと思う
