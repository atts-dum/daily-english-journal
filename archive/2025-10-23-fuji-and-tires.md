## Fuji and tires

### Original
I saw Mt. Fuji covered with snow this morning, allays rained yesterday here, so it had snow there.  
Winter has come. Snowcap is beautiful and very photogenic, not taking a picture was very disappointing.  
I do it every year, so in the near future.  
I will prepare changing the tires normal to stud-less that purchased last winter. But I never had the chance to use them.  
They made in Taiwan. Can I trust tires from a tropical country in winter?

Winter has come. Snowcap is a very pretty place, and it's great for taking pictures. I was very disappointed that I didn't take any pictures.  
I do it every year, so I'll do it again soon.
