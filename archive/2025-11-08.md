Fourth winter has come since Ukraine-Russia war began. No one  expected it to go on this long, it’s a tragedy.  
Y and l saw the photo exhibition, which is hold by a minister, Yuai Christ Church, Nakai Town. M minister visited Ukraine in September, he delivered his town’s souvenirs for children.  
We saw the photos, I was struck by the children’s smiles.
May victory and pease come to Ukraine. I donate 1,000 yen for them.

### Corrected
It's been four winters since the Ukraine-Russia war began. We didn't think it would go on for this long - it's really unfortunate.  
Y and I went to the photo exhibition at the Yuai Christ Church in Nakai Town, which was organised by a minister. Back in September, M, the minister, went to Ukraine and brought some gifts for the kids.  
We saw the photos and I was really struck by the children's smiles.  
May Ukraine enjoy victory and peace. I donate 1,000 yen to them.

Dear people of Ukraine  

I am a retiree who will soon turn 70. I am sorry I cannot be of much help to your suffering.  
It's been four winters since the war between Ukraine and Russia began. I didn't think it would last so long. It's too bad.  

My wife and I went to the photo exhibition at the YUAI Christ Church in Nakai Town, Kanagawa. A pastor organized the exhibition.  
In September, M , the pastor went to Ukraine and brought gifts for the children.  

We saw the photos, and the children's smiles really stood out to me.  
I donated 1,000 yen to his efforts.  

May victory and peace come to Ukraine.  

Best regards,
