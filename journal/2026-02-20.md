## Things to do when getting up early

### Original 🤔
Due to having plans during the day time, I’ve been getting up early and did something these days.  
Writing a journal is one of them.  
The secret to keeping a journal is writing it at a fixed time, but I don’t care.  
Tomorrow my daughter K, her husband M and our adorable granddaughter S will come.  
So I will get up early to writing a journal, but I’ll write about S next day.  

### Corrected 🤖
I have plans during the day, so for the past few days I've been getting up early to take care of some errands.  
Writing my journal is one of them.  
The key to keeping a journal is to write at the same time every day, but I don't stress too much about that.  
Tomorrow, my daughter K, her husband M, and my cute granddaughter S are coming to visit.  
I write my journal early in the morning, but I'll write about S the next day.  

### Memo (dum!)
真っ暗闇の始発電車の音が聞こえるだけの朝です. 
🤖 It's a morning where only the sound of the first train in pitch darkness can be heard.  

### Picked Phrase
- I write my journal early in the morning. 　よくよく考えると日記を書くことが主になるわ納得　🤖 Upon careful reflection, I realize that writing a diary is the main thing.
