## R love
### Original
My son S and his daughter R came home.  
I can meet her about 3 times a year. So today I and Y excited and  became happy.  
We had lunch wife -made sandwiches. R said hungry but she eat only two pieces.  
She is only 4 years old. She is not as all that familiar us and  looked like nervous.  
But l enjoyed chat with her that tone of voice that mimics her mother’s.  
I love R and hope her health.

My son, S, and his daughter, R, came home.  
I get to see her about three times a year. So Y and I were excited and happy to see them today.

She is only four years old. She is not that familiar with us and looked nervous.  
But I enjoyed chatting with her, as she mimics her mother's tone of voice.  
I love R and hope she stays healthy.
