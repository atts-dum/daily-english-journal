## Reviewing finances

### Original
I’am a Retire so have to  support my family finances.  
I live off my pension and contact work earnings, but my expenses high.  
So I should save money, for example, my subscription fees and mobile phon fee.  
I’ll review them in this weekends.  

### Corrected
I’m retired and have to support my family financially.  
I live off my pension and earnings from freelance work, but my expenses are high.  
I should save money on things like subscription and mobile phone fees.  
I’ll review them this weekend.
