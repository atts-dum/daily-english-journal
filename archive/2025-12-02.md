## What do I do for fun?

### Original
What did I interested? What did I like to do in my free time?  
I used to interest climbing, walking, cycling, drive, music listening, singing, reading, play sports, internet browsing, etc. Some things continue to this day, while others have been discontinued.  
From now on I’ll add to  my hobbies photograph, it’s bound to be fun.  

### Corrected
What did I find? When I had some free time, I liked to...  
I used to be into climbing, walking, cycling, driving, music listening, singing, reading, playing sports, browsing the internet, and so on. Some things are still around, while others aren't.  
From now on, I'm going to start adding photography to my list of hobbies. I'm sure it's going to be a blast!
