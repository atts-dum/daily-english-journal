## Three more yeares

### Original 🤔
I believed I may have about ten healthy years left, but it was just hope.  
I checked the fact. According to official research, my healthy years left only three years.  
It means that the healthy life expectancy for Japanese male is 72.57 years.  
Subtract my age to find the sad value.  

## Corrected 🤖
I had hoped I might enjoy another decade or so of good health, but that was nothing more than wishful thinking.  
I've faced the facts. According to official research, my healthy life expectancy has only three years left.  
That is, the healthy life expectancy for Japanese men is 72.57 years,  
and subtracting my age from that yields this sad figure.  

## Memo (dum!)
3年はないよな。せめて5年は健康でいたい。本当に切実な願い

### Picked Phrase
- I’ve faced the facts. ファクトチェックしたと書いたらこうなった。ちょっとAIが才走っているなぁ
