## like mountain climbing 

### Original 🤔
Driving forces me to be tense, but most of boring is my work.  
I try to think that it’s like climbing a mountain.  
Monday I start, Tuesday and Wednesday get tougher and reach the summit.  
Thursday and Friday are boring downhill slope, finally arrive at the goal.  
Because the work is there, I work it.  

### Corrected 🤖
Driving is nerve-wracking, but most of my job is boring.  
I try to think of it like climbing a mountain.  
I start on Monday, face increasing difficulty on Tuesday and Wednesday, and finally reach the summit.  
Thursday and Friday are the boring descent, and it's finally over.  
It's precisely because I have work that I can get through it.  

### Memo (dum!)
「そこに山があるから」とヒラリー卿のセリフを拝借しようと思ったのだけれど、英語でどういったのかな  
🤖 I thought I'd borrow Sir Hillary's line, “Because it's there,” but I wonder how it's said in English.
