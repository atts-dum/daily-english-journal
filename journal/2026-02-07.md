## Plenty to spare

### Original 🤔
I seem to have plenty to spare that I can file my tax return.  
I did it for 4.5 hours today, 10 days left until registration begins.  
But my usual pattern is to get careless.  

### Corrected 🤖
I might just be able to file my tax return with plenty of time to spare.  
I spent about four and a half hours working on it today, and filing opens in ten days.  
But getting complacent is my usual pattern.

### Memo (dum!)
