## Voting

### Original
One of Constitution guaranteed the right is voting, the mayoral election is on the 25th.

### Corrected

This time, three candidates are running as independents. I will not vote for the incumbent; I will vote for the youngest candidate.  
In two weeks, the House of Representatives election will take place. The female prime minister said, “Trust me!” But if you ask me, this election is about “If you love me, prove it.”
