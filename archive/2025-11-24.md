## Start toward the goal

### Original
Recently I started some actions which want to be routine.  
One is reading English grammar book, 650 pages over on 6th November. Second is writing a book on 14th November.  
I don’t want to talk details about them. At the moment I started two things and I have to keep doing them, accomplish anytime.  

### Corrected
I want to keep up with a few new habits I've recently started.  
One is reading an English grammar book—a 650+ page book I began on November 6th.  
The second is finishing writing a book, which I started on November 14th.  
I'll skip the details... but I intend to see both of these projects through to the end.
