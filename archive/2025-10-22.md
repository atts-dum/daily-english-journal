## Curry and rice

### Original
We have curry and rice once a week, tonight’s special is curry with sardine.  
I favorite it and Yuko’s speciality, but she doesn’t like curry and rice so much. Why she make it for dinner?  
Because it easy to cook, can save time she said.  
Ok Yuko. I love curry with sardine, good smell, delicious.
