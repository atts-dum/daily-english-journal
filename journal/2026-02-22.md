## Going fishing with S-chan

### Original 🤔
Yesterday, I went fishing to near lake (Shinsei-ko) with Is.  
For my granddaughter S, it was her first time, and naturally, she didn’t catch anything.  
But I was surprised that she skillfully casted the float far out.  
Interestingly, water birds were slightly frightened by S’s casting and swam away.  

### Corrected 🤖
Yesterday, I went fishing at Shinsei-ko with the I family.  
It was my granddaughter S's first time, and naturally, she didn’t catch anything.  
However, I was surprised by how skillfully she cast the float far out.  
Interestingly, the water birds were slightly frightened by her casting and swam away.  

### Memo (dum!)
水鳥が離れていくと書くと、どうしても飛び去ると訳される　水かきを持っていることを知らないようだ  
🤖  When I wrote “the water birds drifted away,” in Japanese, it inevitably got translated as “flew away.” —as if DeepL don't know they have webbed feet.  
 
### Picked Phrase
- I was surprised by how skillfully she cast the float far out.　この表現気に入った　🤖  I like this phrase.
