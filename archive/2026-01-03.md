## Highway drive to N’s place

### Original
Y and I drove N home to the Tomei Expressway and go back home too.  
The drive there toke hour and half; the return toke twice as long.  
Anyway, N spent our home 2 days, we enjoyed this time.  

### Corrected
We drove N home on the Tomei Expressway. Y and I took Highway Drive to N's place and then went back the same way.  
The drive there took an hour and a half, and the return trip took twice that.  
Anyway, She spent two days at our place, and we had a good time.
