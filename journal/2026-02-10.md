## AI’s Personality

### Original 🤔
I use Gemini and ChatGPT every day.  
I suppose those are smart enough, but I noticed recently they have personality like humans.  
When I chatted them, I say I failed because of your advice.  
Gemini say sorry, but a bit frivolous. The other ChatGPT not apologize and play innocent.  
It's amazing that both of them propose new ideas immediately.  

### Corrected 🤖
I use Gemini and ChatGPT every day.  
I suppose those are smart enough, but I recently noticed that they have personalities like humans.  
When I chatted with them, I said I failed because of your advice.  
Gemini is sorry, but it's a bit silly. The other ChatGPT didn't say sorry and acted like it didn't do anything wrong.  
It's amazing that they both have new ideas right away.  

### Memo (dum!)
とはいえ、両方で6千円の課金は痛い  
🤖 That said, paying 6,000 yen for both is a bit steep.  

### Picked Phrase
- 今日はさえてる　DeepLと遜色ないオリジナルのできばえ  🤖 Today's work is truly outstanding. It's as good as the original, on par with DeepL.
