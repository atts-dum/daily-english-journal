## Wandering person

### Original
During work I saw an old lady who looks like be confused.  
I asked her, “Can I help you? "She said not “Who am I?”, but “Where am I?”.  
I thought she might be dementia and she need help.  
I was on my way to deliver so we went to police box I left her to the police.  

### Corrected
While I was at work, I saw an old lady who looked like she was in a bit of a daze.  
I asked her, "Can I help you? She said, "Where am I?" instead of "Who am I?"  
I thought she might have dementia and need help.  
I was on my way to deliver, so we stopped at the police box. I left her with the police.
