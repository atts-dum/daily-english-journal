## Lost Chance

### Original 🤔
When I stay in my study and hear the sound of a airplane, I always pick up the binoculars or the camera.  
But the camera takes one minutes to pick up it.  
I like to view the flying airplane. Today I heard the unique sound of Osprey (probably a U.S.military aircraft).  
I lost the viewing chance, because it fly so fast and I was slow.  

### Corrected 🤖
Whenever I'm in my study and hear the sound of an airplane, I always grab my binoculars or camera.  
But it takes me a minute to get the camera ready.  
I love watching airplanes fly. Today, I heard the distinctive sound of an Osprey. Probably a U.S. military aircraft.  
It was too fast, and I was too slow, so I missed seeing it.  

### Memo (dum!)
ボクの部屋は北側に大きな窓があり景色が開けているので、飛行中の機体をよく見かける。たまにUFOを見るけど誰も信じてくれない。
多分飛蚊症のせいということになっている。

### Picked Phrase
