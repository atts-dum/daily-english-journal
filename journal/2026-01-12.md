## Heinrich’s law

### Original 🤔
The background of one major injury, there are twenty-nine minor accidents and three-hundred near misses.  
This is Heinrich’s law. I wonder if I’m getting close to one major injury in my job.  
But I’m sure that Idid many near misses and I have time bomb that they say a backache.  

### Corrected 🤖
Behind every major accident lies 29 minor accidents and 300 near misses.  
This is Heinrich's Law. A major accident seems imminent in my own work too.  
But what's certain is that I've experienced many near misses and am carrying a ticking time bomb: back pain.  

### Memo (dum!)
今日だけで2件も踏切の音が鳴り出してから横断してしまった。あと何回残されているやら。  
ところで腰痛って、予兆があってある日突然ドカーンとくるものだっけ？そんな予感がする。  
🤖 Today alone, I crossed the railroad crossing twice after the warning bell started ringing. I wonder how many times I'll get left behind. By the way, does back pain come with warning signs, or does it just suddenly hit me one day? I have a feeling it might.

### Picked Phrase
- ハインリッヒの法則の記述をスマートに訂正してくれました。でもボクとしては上出来じゃない？  🤖 It neatly corrected the description of Heinrich's Law. But I think I did pretty well, don't you?
