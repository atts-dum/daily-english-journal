## Orion

### Original 🤔
I saw Orion for the first time in a long while.  
It’s a familiar constellation visible to the south at a height that doesn’t strain my neck.  
I always used to watch it when I commuted to work and return home in winter.  
But after retiring, I’m usually home during those hours.  

### Corrected 🤖
I saw Orion for the first time in ages.  
It's a familiar constellation shining in the southern sky at a height that doesn't strain my neck.  
I used to look up at it during my winter commute to and from work.  
But since retiring, I'm usually home during those hours.  

### Memo (dum!)
冬の星座を見上げる心の余裕を持とう  
🤖 Let's find the peace of mind to gaze upon the winter constellations.  

### Picked Phrase
- look up
