## A Present for N

### Original
I met my daughter N in Shinjuku after six months, her smile is always lovely.  
I gave her my iPad mini for birthday present. It wasn’t good for me, because the screen was too small to use comfortably.  
She was so grad and I was so happy.  

### Corrected
Half a year had passed since we last met, and I saw my daughter N in Shinjuku. She always has a smile on her face, and that smile is so endearing.  
I gave her my iPad mini as a birthday present. The screen was too small and difficult to use.  
She was delighted, and I was very happy.
