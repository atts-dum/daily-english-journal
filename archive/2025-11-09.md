## Excel Data

### Original
I spent almost all day organizing the Excel data, which inputed my vital data since 2020.  
The sheet contains blood pressure, weight, step count, sleep duration, and so on- recently, I’ve also added a sleep score.  
While these data I’m proud of, the averages and totals were incomplete, so I improved the functions.  
I used AI that was convenient, it’s great!  

### Corrected
I spent almost all day organizing the Excel data, which included my vital data since 2020.  
The sheet's got all sorts of info like blood pressure, weight, how many steps I've taken, how long I slept, and more. I just added a sleep score too.  
I'm happy with the data, but the averages and totals weren't complete, so I enhanced the functions.  
I used AI that was convenient, and it worked great!
