## Police car came

### Original
When I parked on the street at the usual place, and delivered, a resident called police.  
A police car came, a police officer questioned and cautioned me.  
Officer said that you can park on road in this area except in front of the parking lot.  
 I understood, but Is the reporter satisfied now that he got revenge?  

### Corrected
While making deliveries, I parked on the street at the usual spot. A resident called the police.  
A police car arrived, and the officer asked me some questions and gave me a warning.  
The officer explained, "In this area, you can park on the street, except in front of parking lots."  
I understood, but I wonder if the person who called feels satisfied now?  

### Memo (dum!)
まったくいまいましい。通報した男は短気なヤロウで威張りやだ。ポリスも建前しかいわない。気分が悪いクソッ。

### Picked Phrase
- While making deliveries,「配達の最中、いつもの場所に駐車」という語順になるのか、いつまでたっても習得できないな
